<h2><b>Why are they the best?</b></h2>
<p>They are water lizards that are unique in the sense that their lungs are the small crown around them.</p>

	<h3><em>What do these lizards eat?</em></h3>
	<p>Axolotls are interesting in the sense that they mostly eat anything and everything they can, which is dangerous for pet owners as they try to eat gravel which is harmful to them. The best food to feed them is any frozen worms, as this makes sure no bacteria inside living worms can make them sick.</p>
